## Motivation

This behcmark is motivated by a recent question from Ryan Connor on the Âµbioinfo Slack
group

> my impression is that bioinformatics really likes gzip (and only gzip?), but that
> there are other generic compression algs that are better (for bioinfo data types);
> assuming you agree (if not, why not?), why haven't the others compression types caught
> on in bioinformatics?

It kicked off an interesting discussion, which led me to dig into the literature
and see what I could find. I'm sure I could search deeper and for longer, but I really
couldn't find any benchmarks that satisfied me. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of
benchmarks, but they're always looking at bioinformatics-specific tools for compressing
sequencing data. Sure, these perform well, but every repository I went to was untouched
in a while. When archiving data, the last thing I want is to try and decompress my data
and the tool no longer installs/works on my system. In addition, I want the tool to be
ubiquitous and mature. I know this is a lot of constraints, but hey, that's what I am
interested in.

> **This benchmark only covers ubiquitous/mature/generic compression tools**

## Methods

### Tools

The tools tested in this benchmark are:

* [`gzip`][gzip]
* [`xz`][xz]
* [`bzip2`][bzip2]
* [`zstd`][zstd]

These tools were used as they were the main ones that popped up in our discussion. Feel
free to
raise an issue on this repository if you would like to see another tool included.

All compression level settings were tested for each tool and default settings were used
for all other options.

### Data

The data used to test each tool are fastqs:

Note: I couldn't find sources for all of these samples. If you can fill in some of the
gaps, please raise an issue and I will gladly update the sources.

All data were downloaded with [`fastq-dl`][fastq_dl] (v2.0.1). Paired Illumina data were
combined into a single fastq file.

## Results

### Compression ratio

The first question is how much smaller does each compression tool make a fastq file. As
this also depends on the compression level selected, all possible levels were tested for
each tool (the default being indicated with a red circle).

The compression ratio is a percentage of the original file size - i.e.,
$\frac{\text{compressed size}}{\text{uncompressed size}}$.

*Figure 1: Compression ratio (y-axis) for different compression tools and
levels. Compression ratio is a percentage of the original file size. The red circles
indicate the default compression level for each tool. Illumina data is represented with
a solid line and circular points, whereas Nanopore data is a dashed line with cross
points. Translucent error bands represent the 95% confidence interval.*

---

The most striking result here is the noticeable different in compression ratio between
Illumina and Nanopore data - regardless of the compression tool used. (If anyone can
suggest a reason for this, please raise an issue.)

> _**Update 07/06/2023**: [Peter Menzel](https://github.com/pmenzel) mentioned this is
likely due to the noisier quality scores in the Nanopore data. Illumina quality scores
are generally quite homogenous, which increases compressability._

Using default settings, `zstd` and `gzip` provide similar ratios, as do `xz`
and `bzip2` (however, compression level doesn't seem to actually change the ratio
for `bzip2`). When using the highest compression level `xz` provides the best
compression (however, this comes at a cost to runtime as we'll see below).

### (De)compression rate and memory usage

In many scenarios, the (de)compression rate is just as important as the compression
ratio. However, if compressing for archival purposes, rate is probably not as important.

The compression rate is $\frac{\text{uncompressed size}}{\text{(de)compression time (
secs)}}$.

*Figure 2: Compression (left column) and decompression (right column) rate (top row) and
peak memory usage (lower row). Note the log scale for rate. The red circles indicate the
default compression level
for each tool. Illumina data is represented with a solid line and circular points,
whereas Nanopore data is a dashed line with cross points. Translucent error bands
represent the 95% confidence interval.*

---

As alluded to earlier, `xz` pays for its fantastic compression ratios by being
orders-of-magnitude slower than the other tools. It also uses a lot more memory than the
other tools when (de)compressing - although in absolute terms, the highest memory usage
is still well below 1GB.

The main take-away from Figure 2 is that `zstd` (de)compresses **much** faster than the
other tools (using the default level). Compression level seems to have a big impact in
compression rate (except for `bzip2`), however, not so much for decompression.

## Conclusion

So what tool to use? As most often with benchmarks: it depends on your situation.

If all you care about is compressing your data as small as it will go ,and you don't
mind how long it takes, then `xz` - with compression level 9 - is the obvious choice.

If you want fast (de)compression, then `zstd` is the best option - using default
options.

If, like most people, you're contemplating replacing `gzip` (default options), the
siutation is a little
less clear. As a drop-in replacement, `zstd` (default options) will give you about the
same compression
ratio with ~10-fold faster compression and ~3-5-fold faster decompression. Another
option is `bzip2`, which will give you ~1.2-fold better compression ratios than `gzip` (
and `zstd`) with a comparable compression rate to `gzip`. However, `bzip2`'s
decompression rate is ~5-fold slower than `gzip`.

One final consideration is APIs for various programming languages. If it is difficult to
read/write files that are compressed with a given algorithm, then using that compression
type might cause problems. Most (good) bioinformatics tools support `gzip`-compressed
input and output. However, support for other compression types shouldn't be too much
work for most software tool developers provided a well-maintained and documented API is
available in the relevant programming language. Here is a list of APIs for the tested
compression tools in a selection of programming languages with an arbitrary grading
system for how "stable" I think they are (feel free to put in a pull request if you want
to contribute other languages).
